The purpose of this project is to provide a login management system for a client facing website.

This will be used for my own client portal website for onboarding new customers.

This is designed to be a very simple architecture.

Requirements to develop:
mssql engine (any will do, latest is ideal)
dotnet core SDK 5+ (project should ideally be migrated to latest)
docker desktop (docker will be used in production environment)


Requirements to deploy to production:
mssql engine (same as development versions)
dotnet core runtime (same as project targets)
docker (latest version is ideal)

Additonal questions:
Is there a development pipeline? - no, it's unlikely this service will be modified much post production.
Is there formal documentation outside of the readme? - no, due to the simplistic architecutre, documentation is minimal.


Additions to this project can be made, but will require me to approve the pull request.
